    <h1>About This Site</h1>

    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/TcZr7Fp.jpg" alt="Anime collage" class="about-image">

    <p>Welcome to the Anime Character Gallery! This website was created to showcase some of the most popular and iconic anime characters across different universes. I chose anime as the theme because it combines rich storytelling, diverse character designs, and unique powers that make each character memorable.</p>

    <p>The design choices focus on clarity and visual appeal. The dark theme and card-style layout highlight each character's image and key details, while keeping navigation consistent across the site. This static web app serves as a prototype to demonstrate a clean, organized presentation of fictional characters.</p>

    <p>Thank you for visiting! I hope you enjoy exploring these characters as much as I enjoyed putting this gallery together.</p>
